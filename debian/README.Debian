wasm-toolchain for Debian
-------------------------

This is a binary-only package produced by the wasm waterfall which
is hosted at https://wasm-stat.us/.  The code that runs the build
is hosted at https://github.com/WebAssembly/waterfall.

This package includes the following components:

 - upstream llvm including wasm backend (/opt/wasm/llvm)
 - fastcomp llvm (/opt/wasm/fastcomp)
 - emscripten (/opt/wasm/emscripten)
 - binaryen (/opt/wasm/bin/ /opt/wasm/src/js/)
 - wabt (/opt/wasm/bin/)
 - emscripten launcher scripts (/opt/wasm/bin/emcc + em++)

The versions of each of the source package that were used to produce
this package are documented in /opt/wasm/buildinfo.json.

As well as installing files under /opt/wasm the package also uses
the debian alternatives mechanism to install /usr/bin/emcc and
/usr/bin/em++ which point to the scripts in /opt/wasm/bin/emcc.

These wrapper scripts allow emcc and em++ to be used without any
EM_CONFIG or ~/.emscripten (i.e. they provide a pre-configured
version of the toolchain).  The preconfigured toolchain will use
upstream LLVM when EMCC_WASM_BACKEND is set and fastcomp otherwise.
Technically it is still possible to override this with --em-config
on the command line.
