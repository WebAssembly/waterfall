# Waterfall

## ༼ ༎ຶ ෴ ༎ຶ༽ If it’s not tested, it’s already broken.

Luckily, this repository has some tests: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WebAssembly/waterfall.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WebAssembly/waterfall)

# What's this?

This repository holds the code which make the WebAssembly waterfall's heart
beat. You may want to see [the waterfall][] in action, and if you don't like
what you see you may even want to [contribute](Contributing.md).

# What's a waterfall?

WebAssembly has many moving parts and no central owner. Some of these interact
closely, some implement the same thing. A build and test waterfall allows us to:

* Have simple build instructions for each component.
* Archive build logs and build artifacts.
* Identify which build artifacts are known-good.
* Know which tests matter.
* Make tests easily executable.
* Know which configurations matter (build flavor, host OS, host architecture,
  ...).
* Cause inadvertent breakage less often.
* When breakage occurs, identify it quickly and reverted / silenced / fixed
  easily.
* When a big change is required, know which moving parts should synchronize.
* Make the feature implementation status straightforward to check for each
  component.

We should keep process to a minimum, try things out, see what works.

# How do I run it?

1. Get the sources: `$ git clone https://github.com/WebAssembly/waterfall.git`
2. Run build.py `python src/build.py`
