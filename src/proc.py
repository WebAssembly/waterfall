# This module is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the standard
# subprocess module, with the difference that it logs commands before it runs
# them. Everything not overriden should pass through to the subprocess module
# via the import trick below.

# Imports subprocess in its own namespace so we can always refer directly to
# its attributes.
import subprocess
import os
import sys
# Imports all of subprocess into the current namespace, effectively
# re-exporting everything.
from subprocess import * # flake8: noqa


def FixPython(cmd):
  if cmd[0].endswith('.py'):
    return [sys.executable] + cmd
  return cmd

# Now we can override any parts of subprocess we want, while leaving the rest.
